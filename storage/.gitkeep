# Uploads Directory

This directory is used to store uploaded files from the multipart plugin.

Files uploaded through the API will be stored here with unique filenames to prevent conflicts.

## File Structure
- Original filename is preserved in the response
- Actual stored filename includes timestamp and random ID
- Files are accessible via `/uploads/<filename>` endpoint

## Security Notes
- File types are validated before upload
- Maximum file size is limited to 10MB by default
- Directory permissions should be properly configured in production
