# Project Overview

## About AegisX Boilerplate
AegisX Boilerplate is a production-ready Fastify API boilerplate designed for Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) and ERP applications. Built with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and enterprise-grade infrastructure.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Fastify v5.2.1 (high-performance API) + Angular 20 (frontend)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing (dual setup: Node.js + Browser)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Knex.js for migrations/queries
- **Validation**: TypeBox for schema validation
- **Architecture**: Nx monorepo with layered architecture (apps/ + libs/)
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with standalone components
- **UI Framework**: PrimeNG 20 RC + Angular CDK + custom CSS utilities
- **Shared Libraries**: Type-safe communication between frontend/backend
- **Caching**: Redis with connection pooling
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for enterprise messaging
- **Authentication**: JWT + Refresh tokens + API Keys
- **Authorization**: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- **Logging**: Winston structured logging with multiple adapters
- **Monitoring**: Seq and Grafana + Loki support
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0
- **Image Processing**: Sharp.js for comprehensive image operations

## Healthcare Context
This is designed for healthcare applications requiring:
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Role-based access for healthcare roles
- Scalable architecture for enterprise healthcare systems

## Current Implementation Status
